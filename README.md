Keep this branch open and empty. We have 2 separate branches named x86_64_dev and armv6l_dev that form the base branch. Each of the base dev branches are meant to signify the code on `various hardware platforms`
1. x86_64 : is a branch for hosting on the cloud. - x86_64
2. armv6l : is branch for hosting code running the IoT device. - armv6l

These branches arent expected merge any further as they signify distinct hardware platforms. More so they would also have distinct CI CD pipelines.
